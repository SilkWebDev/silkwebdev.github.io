                              We chose Jim Kerr to build our garden room
                              extension following a recommendation by our
                              architect and we weren't disappointed as he proved
                              to be knowledgeable in all aspects of the build
                              from studying the plans (and tweaking them where
                              necessary) to constructing the building.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              He liaised confidently with Building Control, with
                              whom he has a good relationship, the thermal
                              energy consultant and the glazing supplier. The
                              build was certainly not without its complications
                              but Jim and Dan, the groundworks expert, dealt
                              with these without being phased in the slightest.

                              We are in a low lying position with little fall
                              but Jim designed and put in place, with Daryl and
                              James, a system to take away the rainwater. This
                              involved digging a trench across the lawn but by
                              the time they had finished we could hardly notice
                              that it had been disturbed.

                              and tidy. Virtually at the end of every day Jim
                              would explain what the next phase entailed so that
                              we knew exactly what would be happening next and

                              He manages the whole process from inception to
                              completion, dealing with all aspects of the
                              project. We would strongly recommend his company.

                              To enable a dream to become a reality, I needed a
                              project manager, a mediator to the local county
                              council at every appropriate stage of the build
                              <i><b>and</b></i> a manager of an exceptional team
                              of professionals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              This is exactly what was delivered. I highly
                              recommend the services of J. S. Kerr Building
                              Limited and his team. While Jim and his team
                              transformed our house over an eight month period,

                              of the house (suspended floors and a big drop at
                              the rear of the property) and some key elements of

                              Jim and his team were excellent throughout.

                              There were some technical challenges in the design
                              e.g. with some extremely large steels that had
                              been specified. Jim ensured that he found a way to
                              make it work. We are very pleased with the end
                              result and would highly recommend Jim and his

                            <p>
                              Jim explained every stage from start to finish,
                              making the process appear easy. His skilled team
                              are respectful and helpful, all working to a high
                              standard, leaving the site tidy. This was not a
                              project for the faint-hearted, but the results are
                              outstanding. The oak beams created by Shane are so
                              impressive, resulting in an overall luxurious
                              finish.
                            </p>
                            <p>Thank you Team!</p>

                              materials.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              We engaged the services of Jim Kerr for a single
                              storey extension to our semi-detached Victorian
                              property. The first phase had been undertaken by a
                              previous builder but Jim was happy to undertake
                              the further work required.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              From groundworks to the final finish, Jim used
                              reliable, prompt and efficient tradesmen and
                              supervised the job throughout, ensuring steel
                              supports were correctly installed and setting up
                              the new insulated floor at the correct level.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The job was not without challenges but Jim
                              approached these with a calm and professional
                              manner. Jim was quick to respond to any queries or
                              concerns we, as clients, might have, almost always
                              with a personal phone call. The electricians,
                              plumbers, heating engineers, plasterers, painters
                              and roofers, all worked to a high standard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Jim insisted on leaving his site tidy, clean as
                              possible and free from rubbish and hazards,
                              organising all equipment at the end of each day,
                              which really helped to keep the disruption of
                              undertaking a building project, to a minimum.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Jim was also a fantastic manager of his workforce,
                              and at every point in the process, made sure work
                              progressed smoothly and there were no hold ups.
                              Daryl, his regular labourer, and James, were well
                              directed, hard working and always friendly and
                              polite. They were appreciative of teas and coffees
                              when we could provide them, without expectation.
                              We are both very happy with Jim's services and if
                              he were not so busy, would keep him around to
                              exclusively attend to our other projects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Seriously, we were fortunate to find him and his
                              team and can't recommend him highly enough. Thank
                              you, Jim.
